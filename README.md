Perlin noise based procedural terrain generation using p5.js.

In `src` you can find the final version of the p5.js sketch. Under 
`src/intermediate-versions` you can look at earlier iterations of the code that 
build up into the final result.

To see the results of any of the intermediate versions, replace 
`<script src="src/sketch.js"></script>` in `index.html` with the relevant file
path.
